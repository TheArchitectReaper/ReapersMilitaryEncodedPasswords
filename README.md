**Password Encoder: Military Phonetic Alphabet Conversion Tool**

This Python script allows you to encode a password into a series of military phonetic alphabet terms, offering a unique and fun way to represent your password. Each character of the password is mapped to its corresponding military term (e.g., 'a' becomes "alpha", 'b' becomes "bravo", and so on). The output is presented with directional arrows (↑↓) separating the terms to mimic a visual encoding style.

### Key Features:

* **Character Mapping**: Supports lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters like punctuation, mapping each to a corresponding phonetic term.
* **Readable Encoding**: Outputs the password as a series of military phonetic alphabet terms, separated by arrows, for better visualization and understanding.
* **User-Friendly**: Continuously prompts the user for input, allowing for multiple passwords to be encoded without restarting the program.
* **Handles Special Characters**: Special characters and spaces are encoded with unique terms, making this tool versatile for a wide range of inputs.

### Example:

For a password input like `Pa$$w0rd`, the output will be:

```
Papa↑↓alpha-capitalized↑↓dollarsign↑↓dollarsign↑↓whiskey↑↓zero↑↓romeo↑↓delta
```

### Ideal Use Cases:

* **Password Visualization**: For those who want to "see" their passwords in a more secure or memorable format.
* **Learning Tool**: Helps users familiarize themselves with the NATO phonetic alphabet and the way it applies to letters and symbols.
* **Fun with Security**: A creative and playful approach to encoding passwords, though not meant for cryptographic security.
